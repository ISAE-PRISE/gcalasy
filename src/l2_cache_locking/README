The aim of this project is to analyze the effect of L2 cache locking for interference mitigation in three scenarios: 
1. Inter-SM interference with one application
2. Inter-SM interference with several applications (mix-criticality scenario)
3. LPDDR5 memory and inter-SM interference with one application
