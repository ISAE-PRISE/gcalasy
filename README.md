Copyright (C) 2023 ISAE-SUPAERO 

Studying the response of cache memory interference to hardware-based cache locking technique on iGPUs


### Description:

"src/l2_cache_locking_orin64/": This workspace contains the files for performing L2 cache locking tests. 
			     It has been tested on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin 64GB MPSoC and with Cuda 11.4.

### Software Requirements:

1. NVIDIA GPUs with a compute capability of 8.0 or above is required.
   
2. CUDA 11.0 or higher is required (/usr/local/cuda-11.x).
